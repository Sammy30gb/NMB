          <h1>Abstract</h1>
          <p>
            Following the introduction of the Microfinance Policy framework by Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)
             in December 2005, the stage was set for Microfinance banks in Nigeria to contribute their quota towards
              the economic development of the nation. These they were to accomplish by enhancing the access of 
              micro-entrepreneurs and low-income households to financial services required to help them expand and
               modernize their operations. This paper therefore examines the extent to which Nigerian Microfinance
                Banks have played this role of being agents of economic development as seen from the Nwannegadi 
                Microfinance Bank perspective. The study concluded that indeed Microfinance banks have a significant 
                impact on economic development and given there are obstacles towards performing this noble role of 
                being agents of economic development that such obstacles could be overcome by Microfinance banks when 
                they adhere strictly to the Microfinance policy and guidelines as put forward by the Central Bank
                 of Nigeria and also by being a little bit more innovative and adaptive to their operating environment. 
                 On its part, the CBN is advised to streamline and strengthen the policies guiding the operations of 
                 microfinance banks, while the Federal Government agencies restrict themselves to granting developmental
                  funds through MFB’s rather than undertaking the disbursement of these loans by themselves.

          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            In December 2005, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) introduced a microfinance policy framework to 
            enhance the access of micro-entrepreneurs and low-income households to financial services required to 
            help expand and modernize their operations so as to enable them contribute their own quota towards rapid 
            economic growth.
          </p>
          <p>Microfinance services refer to loans, deposits, insurance, fund transfer and other ancillary 
            non-financial products targeted at low income customers. Three features distinguish microfinance
             from other financial products namely:</p>
          <div class="logo-text" style="margin-top: -15px;">
            <img src="/logo/Rectangle 102.png" alt="">
          <p>Smallness of loans and savings </p>

          <div class="logo-text" style="margin-top: -15px;">
            <img src="/logo/Rectangle 102.png" alt="">
          <p>Absence or reduced emphasis on collateral </p>

          <div class="logo-text" style="margin-top: -15px;">
            <img src="/logo/Rectangle 102.png" alt="">
          <p>Simplicity of operations. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-content">
          <p>
            Before the emergence of Microfinance Banks under the microfinance policy of the CBN, Community Banks 
            were in existence and were mainly targeted at the low-income earners to help sort out their financial 
            problems. Community banks however encountered a lot of problems that resulted in many of them becoming 
            distressed. According to the CBN, the prolonged sub optimal performance of many erstwhile community banks,
             Microfinance and development finance institutions were due to incompetent management, weak internal controls and lack 
             of deposit insurance schemes. Other factors the CBN indicated include poor corporate governance, lack of well-defined operations, 
             restrictive regulatory and supervisory requirements amongst others. Following this development, the community banks that survived 
             the distress were converted to Microfinance Banks while new Microfinance Banks were registered.
          </p>
          <p>This paper therefore examines the extent to which Microfinance Banks have impacted the economic 
            development of the country and in doing so it is organized into five sections:</p>

        <h1>Conceptual issues of Microfinance Policy</h1>
        <p>The microfinance policy provides a platform to achieve specific objectives which occlude among others:-</p>
        <div class="logo-text" style="margin-top: -15px;">
          <img src="/logo/Rectangle 102.png" alt="">
         <p>Provision of timely, diversified, affordable and dependable financial services to the economically active poor.</p>
       </div>
        <div class="logo-text" style="margin-top: -15px;">
          <img src="/logo/Rectangle 102.png" alt="">
         <p>Enhancement of service delivery to micro, small, and medium enterprises.</p>

        <div class="logo-text" style="margin-top: -15px;">

         <p>Mobilization of savings for intermediation and rural transformation.</p>
       </div>
        <div class="logo-text" style="margin-top: -15px;">
          <img src="/logo/Rectangle 102.png" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
         <p>Creation of employment opportunities and increase the productivity and household income of the active poor
           in the country thereby enhancing their standard of living.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="logo-text" style="margin-top: -15px;">
        <img src="/logo/Rectangle 102.png" alt="">
       <p>Promotion of synergy and mainstreaming of the informal microfinance subsector into the formal financial system.</p>
     </div>
     <p>These policy objectives were aimed at achieving a number of goals among which are:</p>
     <div class="logo-text" style="margin-top: -15px;">
      <img src="/logo/Rectangle 102.png" alt="">
     <p>To increase access to financial services of the economically active poor by 10 percent annually.</p>
     
   </div>
   <div class="logo-text" style="margin-top: -15px;">
    <img src="/logo/Rectangle 102.png" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
   <p>To increase the share of microcredit as a percentage of total credit to the economy from 0.9% in 2005 to at 
    least 20% in 2020, and the share of microcredit as a percentage of GDP from 0.2% in 2005 to at least 5% in 2020.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="logo-text" style="margin-top: -15px;">
    <img src="/logo/Rectangle 102.png" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
   <p>To ensure the participation of all States and Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as well as at least two-thirds 
    of all Local Government Areas (LGA) in microfinance activities by 2015.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="logo-text" style="margin-top: -15px;">
    <img src="/logo/Rectangle 102.png" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
   <p>To eliminate gender disparity by ensuring that women’s access to financial services increases by 15% annually, that is 5% above the stipulated minimum of 10% across the board.</p>
   </div>
   <p>Thus, the microfinance policy was structured in such a manner as to correct the noticeable lapses of the community
     banking era thereby strengthening microfinance institutions to be active participants in the emerging global 
     financial system. This notwithstanding, the CBN in 2010 revoked the licenses of 224 microfinance banks out of the
      820 then in existence in the country. According to the CBN a significant number of microfinance banks were
       deficient in their understanding of the microfinance concept and the methodology for the delivery of microfinance
        services to the targeted groups. Many of them according to the CBN, lost focus and were competing with regular
         commercial banks for customers and deposits, leaving the target market unattended. The factors that contributed
          to the unsoundness of these microfinance banks according to the CBN include: high level of non-performing 
          loans resulting in high portfolio being at risk which had impaired their capital and gross 
          under-capitalization in relation to the level of operation. </p>
          <p>Coupled with this is the fact that many of the microfinance banks had poor corporate governance 
            and incompetent boards, high level of non-performing insider related credit and other forms of insider
             abuse. Also, according to the CBN, many of the microfinance banks made heavy investments in the capital 
        market with the resultant diminution in value of the investment after the meltdown in the capital market.</p>
        <p> Following this distress, the CBN in 2011 reviewed the microfinance banks policy. Under the new guidelines, the microfinance 
          banks would now operate under 3 categories which include Unit, State, National Microfinance Banks.</p>
          <p>A unit microfinance bank is authorized to operate in one location. It shall be required to have a minimum paid 
            up capital of 20 million Naira and is prohibited from having branches and cash centers. By the year 2020 this was 
            modified with unit microfinance bank category being broken into 2tiers. Tier 1-unit MFB is required to have a 
            minimum capital base of N200m, while Tier 2 shall have a minimum paid up capital of N50m.</p>
            <p>A State microfinance bank is authorized to operate in one state of the Federation or the FCT. It shall be required to
               have a minimum paid up capital of 100 million Naira and is allowed to open branches within the same state or 
               FCT subject to prior written approval by the CBN for each new branch. By 2020 the required paid up capital was 
               reviewed upwards to N1bn.</p>
        <p>A National microfinance bank on the other hand is authorized to operate in more than one state including the FCT. 
          It shall be required to have a minimum paid up capital of 2 billion Naira and is allowed to open branches in all 
          states of the Federation and the FCT subject to prior written approval by the CBN. By 202 the required minimum 
          paid up capital was reviewed upwards from N2bn to N5bn. </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 600;">The extent to which MFBs have contributed in Economic Development. The “Nwannegadi Microfinance Bank”
       (NMFB) Perspective.</p>
       <p>Economic development is a process of structural transformation involving technological innovation that leads to increased labor productivity and improvement in infrastructure which reduces transaction costs. Entrepreneurial development has been known to be crucial in advancing structural transformation which us essential for attaining broad-based economic development.
        Economic development can therefore be defined as the development of capacities that expand economic actors’ capabilities. It is a broader concept than economic growth as it reflects social and economic progress and requires economic growth. Growth on its own is a vital and necessary condition for development but it is not a sufficient condition as it cannot guarantee development. 
         Therefore, the access to financial services is an important factor in reaching for growth and development but there are other influences such as the state of technologies available to the borrower and the relative prices of capital, labor and other inputs which are beyond the control of MFBs. For example, the impact that loans will have on employment depends on the technology that the loan is invested in.
         Therefore, if microfinance banks are successfully reaching large numbers of poor households and increasing their incomes by giving them access to credit to fund private enterprises then they would certainly be contributing to economic development as can be seen by the outreach of Nwannegadi Microfinance Bank.</p>
     
     <p>Economic development can be measured using such indicators as Per Capita income, Life expectancy, Education and the level of poverty, all of which can be proxied by Human Development Index (HDI).
      Using Human Development Index therefore, many scholars have through various studies shown that Microfinance 
      has contributed a lot to economic development in Nigeria. Example, Tafamel (2019) examined the effect of
       microfinance institutions on Reduction of Poverty as well as increasing entrepreneurial activities in Nigeria
        and concluded that microfinance has significant and positive impacts on both variables.</p>
        <p>Also studies by Khalaf (2019), Ugochukwu and Onochie (2017) and Ikefan et al (2016) all confirmed the relevance of microfinance to poverty reduction and economic development.
          Microfinance therefore has been shown to have huge capacity to boost economic development as it supports Micro, 
          small and medium scale enterprises.</p>
          <p> NMFB secured its full operating license in December 2007 following the application by its promoters – The Catholic Diocese of Orlu, Imo state, thereby becoming the first microfinance bank in the entire South East geopolitical zone of Nigeria, and the fifth in the entire nation to be given an operating license by the CBN. The banks motto, ‘You must survive’ follows from its’ name ‘Nwannegadi’ Igbo name literally meaning 
            “my brothers and sisters must survive”.</p>
            <p>By 2007 NMFB was operating on a capital base of 20 million Naira as a unit
               MFB required by law but by early 2012 the asset base of the bank has gone up to 400 million Naira and so the bank secured approval and was licensed as a state MFB, the first in Imo state. With this and a positive probability index, the bank has since its inception liquidated all its preliminary expenses following which it has started rendering adequate returns on shareholders’ investments. Currently, Nwannegadi Microfinance has complied with the directive of CBN and raised its capital base to N1bn. The status of state MFB has further widened the reach of NMFB as its cliental base has increased tremendously.

            </p>
            <p>In 2008, the effective and efficient microfinance operation of NMFB was affirmed by the 39 microfinance banks in Imo state when they approved NMFB as the leading microfinance bank in the state to facilitate the collaboration agenda of Imo Microfinance banks for best practices. Also, by December 2008, the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) recognized NMFB as the best institution of core micro-financing in the South East geopolitical zone of Nigeria. These recognitions and others not mentioned here are not a fluke by any means, for the bank has earned them.

        <p>With all of these, the bank has remained committed to its vision of being the most reliable corporate ally inspired to provide excellent banking and financial services to Micro-entrepreneurs and low-income households as a way of helping them to modernize and expand their operations, so that they can contribute to the development of the Nigerian economy in a sustainable manner.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: 600;">Challenges and Prospects of Improvement by MFBs in this onerous task of positively contributing to the economic development of the country.</p>
        <p> The challenges faced by all microfinance banks in Nigeria including NMFB are numerous but a few of the important ones was highlighted in this study. These include but not limited to the existence of little awareness among the populace about the activities of MFBs, rather we have so much information about the working of normal universal/consolidated banks.</p>  
        <p>Many microfinance banks lack the basic infrastructure that can help them smoothen out their operations and this ultimately results to high operational costs.
          There is also the dearth of quality investments in MFBs by financially well to do Nigerians who would rather invest in the ‘billion-naira profit making consolidated banks’
          There exists also the problem of insufficient support from the regulators and government. MFBs keep witnessing poor buy-ins and cooperation from the State and Local Governments, e.g. the policy direction towards the millennium development goals is that one percent of the annual votes of the States and LGAs should be channeled to MFBs for on-lending to the poor and low to medium scale entrepreneurs but so far very few states have taken steps to get this started.
         There is also the problem of undue competition rather than cooperation from the Mega Banks. Universal banks have enough financial muscle that they do not want to touch the loans of the poor and micro-entrepreneurs because of the high risks and high transaction costs but rather than compliment the activities of MFBs they discredit them by painting pictures of instability, unsustainability, poor capitalization, etc. to the vulnerable micro-clients and potential investors. Also, correspondence banks are hardly supportive of MFBs.</p>      
      <p>Coupled with all these is the existence of possible malpractice by microfinance operators themselves. In this respect MFBs are advised in their own interest to deal with the clients with utmost integrity. Customers must know upfront what their charges are. There should be no hidden or cosmetic cost.</p>
    <p>Viewing all the challenges posed above the picture of the future for MFBs might appear to be gloomy but this should not be so because there are prospects for improvement as noted below.</p>   
   <p> The CBN has quite some role to play in stabilizing the microfinance industry. There is need for the CBN and NDIC to monitor MFBs operations closely by strengthening their inspectorate departments to ensure compliance of the MFBs to the stated rules and regulations. They should also carry out extensive campaigns to assure the public that MFBs are highly regulated and safe banking institutions.
    There is need to implement a well-designed training programmes for all stakeholders in the microfinance banking sector as a way of enhancing capacity building. Microfinance banks need increased funding for them to be able to effectively render the much-needed financial services to the underbanked or unbanked especially micro entrepreneurs.
     Government arms should restrict themselves to granting development funds through MFBs rather than undertaking these loans themselves. They should adhere to the microfinance policy by giving poverty alleviation funds to MFBs developmental projects.
    The built up SMEEIS reserves in universal banks should be invested in or through MFBs as equity, seed funds or low interest loans for on-lending to the poor and SMEs. Also, international donor agencies should review their funding disbursements to the poor by channeling same through MFBs registered by the CBN.</p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>Microfinance banks are truly agents of economic development as they have huge capacity to support and boost the activities of small and medium scale enterprises and poor households thereby increasing their incomes, reducing poverty and increasing the standard of living as could be seen from the Nwannegadi microfinance bank perspective.</p>
  <p>However, for them to achieve this, all stakeholders in the microfinance industry must work in concert to overcome the identified challenges so as to truly position MFBs as they contribute their quota towards the economic growth and development of the Nation generally.
