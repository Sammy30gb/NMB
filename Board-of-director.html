          <h1>Background Information </h1>
          <p>
            The Board of Nwannegadi Microfinance Bank carries out its oversight functions using various committees, making for greater efficiency and deeper attention to specific matters. The Bank has four (4) standing committees and one (1) statutory committee set up in accordance with the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA), 2020. The Board members normally have a minimum of three (3) tenors of 4 years each.
            The Board leveraged on diverse membership of the committees of the Board to bring the best use of their skills and experience as non-executive directors in particular to enhance the performance of the Bank. The Board had much earlier established the various committees with well-defined terms of reference and charters defining their scope of responsibilities in such a way as to avoid overlap or duplication of functions.
          </p>
          <p>The committees of the Board met quarterly during the period.</p>
