          Distinguished members of Nwannegadi Microfinance Bank Nigeria Limited, I warmly welcome you to the 
          9th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of our highly revered bank Nwannegadi Microfinance Bank Nigeria Limited. 
          We thank God for preserving our lives to witness another Annual General Meeting of our bank. </p>
        
           <p>Ladies and gentlemen permit me to Start on a note of deep gratitude for the wonderful opportunities 
           and honour given to us the board members to preside over the affairs of the bank alongside the management 
           for the past one year.</p>  
          <p>The past twelve months witnessed the activities of the bank being
             operated in line with the strategic
            development plan of the bank in our area and the state in general.</p>

          <h1>The State of the Nation:</h1>
          <p>Today we are going to showcase the operational result of our bank in the year 2023. We shall also look at the harsh economic challenges that impaired the attainment of our set goals during the year, and the achievement recorded. The year began with economic and social crises ranging from the scarcity of the newly introduced new Naira notes to replace the existing N200, N500, and N1,000 notes, the February 2023 general elections, 
            the near collapse of security in all parts of the country.</p>
         <p>Further to that, the corporate Nigeria and other components of the national economy operated with severe 
          structural and institutional constraints, including a deficient economic infrastructural base and fiscal policy
           instability, hyper inflation, high deficit budgeting, excruciating foreign and domestic debt burden as well as 
           high rate of unemployment were among the myriads of factors that impaired the attainment of government economic a
           genda for its citizens.</p>
           <p>The Nigeria’s expectation of a bountiful democratic harvest following the inauguration of a new administration in the country was overwhelmed with unprecedented turn of things, following the declaration of removal of oil subsidy. The hike in the pump prices of fuel  and its attendant backslash, affected demand and supply of essential goods and services, others including scarcity of most essential commodities, the nation recorded over 33% inflation rate, the value of Naira crash landed, affecting the purchasing powers of the people. 
            All the government policies to mitigate the impact on the people failed to show any positive results.</p>

            <div>
              <h1>Operating Results</h1>
              <p>A general overview of the economy reveals that most businesses found it increasingly difficult to breakeven during the year owing to the constraints earlier highlighted. Although some of the consequences of this harsh operating environment reflected on
                our bottom-line by the experience of high operating overhead, low loan disbursement,
                 low profit margin, etc.</p>
                 <p>However, we engaged in economic mitigation to enable our bank navigate through the current constrains. The decision was informed by the need to defend our bank against the threat of recession 
                  arising from the negative consequences of economic downturn.</p>

            </div>
         </div>
           <p>Notwithstanding the unprecedented turbulent conditions created by the economic meltdown during the review period, the bank as at December 31, 2023 achieved a Profit After Tax of N120 million, as against the sum of N92 million made in the year 2022, representing 30.43% percent increase. The shareholders fund stood at N1.152 Billion as against the sum of N729 Million recorded
             as at the end of year 2022.</p>
          
             <p>It is important to note that posting such appreciable performance under the current unhealthy operating environment, was as a result of pragmatic and robust business decisions undertaken by the board and management of the bank. The appreciable liquidity position reflected in our balance sheet made us to continue to lend to individuals and groups in support of micro loans, small and medium scale enterprises loans as our contribution to the socio economic development of the people of Imo State.
              In the year 2023 under review, we achieved completion and commissioning of our new head office complex. 
              Today, we are operating from our own office complex.</p>
              <h1>Dividend</h1>
              <p>Distinguished shareholders, following the performance of the Bank during the review year, the Board of Directors is recommending a cash dividend of 10 kobo for every share held as dividend on your investment for the period ended December 31, 2023. 
                The approval of the shareholders is hereby sought for this recommendation.</p>
              <h1>Board</h1>
              <p>Ladies and gentlemen, during the review year, the Board carried out some changes in its composition. The name of late Very Rev Monsignor Patrick Obinabu was removed from the list of the Board of Directors of the Bank. New appointments were made in the person of Chief Sir John I Agbasi and Rev Fr. Dr
                Remigius C. Olisah. Their confirmation by CBN is being awaited. 
                On your behalf, I will like to welcome and wish them a successful tenure as directors.</p>
                <h1>Future Outlook</h1>
                <p>Distinguished shareholders, Nwannegadi Microfinance Bank Nigeria Limited, your bank will continue to introduce products aimed at instituting a functional poverty eradication
                  agenda for the economically active people at the lower strata of the economic pyramid of society through microfinance best practices in years ahead and also to grow to become Nation-wide Microfinance Bank.
                  </p>
                  <p>In the coming years, prudence and vigilance will be essential, and Nwnnegadi Microfinance Bank Nigeria Limited strength and experience offers a platform to turn the current turbulent season into opportunity. We are committed to continuing to deepen our clients’ relationships and staying alert to opportunities as they arise. We have designed business continuity processes to ensure that our bank’s services are delivered
                     to all our customers irrespective of their location in Imo state and beyond.</p>

                        <h1>Appreciation</h1>
                        <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we owe a debt of gratitude to our esteemed shareholders for their confidence reposed in us and our valued customers for their unflinching loyalty and continued patronage.
                        </p>
                           <p>Let me seize this opportunity to thank members of the Board for their immense contributions, members of management team for their excellent co-operation in achieving our corporate objectives in the review period, and the staff for guiding the bank during the most difficult part of this our national life, and for aggressively repositioning the bank to meet the challenges during the next phase of our growth.
                          </p>
                          <p>I have no doubt that the enthusiasm of the board, management, and staff, and their commitment and determination, will ensure that the
                             success enjoyed in the review year is sustained, and indeed enhanced in subsequent financial years.</p>
                        </div>
                      </div>
                    
             <h1>Conclusion</h1>   
             <p>Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, the year 2023 was extraordinary and it made extraordinary 
              demands on many of our people. The banking industry currently has rightly been under considerable watch 
              and the banking public has become apprehensive on the real situation in the industry. It is through our 
              board and management that Nwannegadi Microfinance Bank’s distinctive character stands out for customers, and who ensured that not all microfinance banks are the same. I am also particularly grateful to our shareholders for their faith and continued support. Based on our combined effort, I have no doubt that we can successfully execute the goals we have set for ourselves in the coming financial years. Distinguished shareholders, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you most sincerely for your kind patience and attention.
            </p>   
            <p>God bless you, God bless Nwannegadi, God bless Imo State and God bless Nigeria.  Thank you.</p>
